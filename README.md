# Futuristic Visor Helmet 3D Showcase

## Overview

This application showcases an interactive 3D model of a Futuristic Visor Helmet. Users can scroll through different views of the helmet, which is displayed alongside descriptive text that aligns contextually with the model's orientation.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React 18.2.0 with `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` for 3D model rendering
- Backend: None, static hosting suitable due to client-side rendering
- API: None, as there is no server-side interaction
- Database: None, as there is no data persistence requirement
- Hosting: Local/[Demo](https://h8hnlr.csb.app/)

## Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd helmet_3d_showcase`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Local Running Steps

1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3000` (default React port)

## Application Structure

- `Overlay`: A React component that allows users to scroll through different sections, each corresponding to a view of the 3D helmet model.
- `Model`: The 3D model of the helmet, which reacts to scroll events and updates its orientation accordingly.
- `styles.css`: Contains the styling for the application, ensuring text and model alignment as per the current section.

## Possible Next Steps

- Add user interaction to the 3D model, allowing users to click and drag to rotate the model manually.
- Integrate analytics to understand user engagement with different views of the model.
- Enhance the visual design with additional CSS or WebGL shaders for more realistic effects.
- Prepare the application for deployment by optimizing asset loading and considering CDN hosting for the model files.
